This project is straightforward and doesn’t allow complex bonuses. However, we trust
your creativity. If you completed the mandatory part, give a try to this bonus part.
Here are the bonus part requirements:
• Develop get_next_line() using only one static variable.
• Your get_next_line() can manage multiple file descriptors at the same time.
For example, if you can read from the file descriptors 3, 4 and 5, you should be
able to read from a different fd per call without losing the reading thread of each
file descriptor or returning a line from another fd.
It means that you should be able to call get_next_line() to read from fd 3, then
fd 4, then 5, then once again 3, once again 4, and so forth.
Append the _bonus.[c\h] suffix to the bonus part files.
It means that, in addition to the mandatory part files, you will turn in the 3 following
files:
• get_next_line_bonus.c
• get_next_line_bonus.h
• get_next_line_utils_bonus.c
The bonus part will only be assessed if the mandatory part is
PERFECT. Perfect means the mandatory part has been integrally done
and works without malfunctioning. If you have not passed ALL the
mandatory requirements, your bonus part will not be evaluated at all.
